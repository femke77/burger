Burger is a Node/Express web app for creating and devouring burgers!

## Tech/Framework Used

Burger is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and is hosted on Heroku at

https://infinite-dawn-54814.herokuapp.com/


It is built with Nodejs and Expressjs. It uses MySQL for the database, which on Heroku, is JAWSDB. The npm libraries that help make this app work are express-handlebars and mysql. HTML is served with handlebars. The ORM was coded by me.

## How to use

https://infinite-dawn-54814.herokuapp.com/

You may or may not see burgers that are either waiting to be eaten, or are already eaten when you open the above link. Eat any burger you want! Go ahead and add more burgers to your heart's content using the Add Burger form at the bottom of the page. 

## Motivation

This app was written to learn ORM's, and to practice with MySQL and Node/Express. To refresh my basic CSS skills, I wrote all of it myself rather than using Bootstrap, which I normally do. This project also helped me get better with Handlebars.

## Credits

NPM libraries: mysql, express, express-handlebars
